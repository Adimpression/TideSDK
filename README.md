TideSDK
=======

TideSDK (formerly Titanium Desktop) is a remarkable project inherited from Appcelerator. It is now managed as community open source project by group dedicated to the availability of this unique solution. 

The ability to deploy a Webkit-based desktop application across all three major desktop operating systems, with privileged access to native APIs, has empowered web developers to escape the browser and deliver rich, "always on" desktop apps. 

Users create applications using familiar HTML5, JavaScript and CSS technologies. Beyond this, the unique support for Python, PHP and Ruby extend the capabilities of TideSDK beyond the realm of any competitive framework. Further, our plans include the expansion and extension TideSDK's API's for even better, more complex, and reliable user experiences on the desktop as we move forward.


Getting and Using TideSDK
-------------------------

Downloads are available for the previous Titanium Desktop 1.2.0.RC4 in the interim as we prepare for our first release candidate 1.2.1.RC1. These are the downloads area for the project:

* [https://github.com/TideSDK/TideSDK/downloads](https://github.com/TideSDK/TideSDK/downloads)

The API's will remain compatible so there is nothing to fear with a transition from Titanium Desktop and TideSDK in the near future.

Our enhanced documentation efforts are in progress and our docs will be hosted with read-the-docs in multiple languages. While these efforts are underway, please refer to Appcelerator's API docs that ar available as a download in our downloads area.

You will find us building other resources to support you in our Wiki:
