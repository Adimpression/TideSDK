TideSDK Desktop
===============

TideSDK (formerly Titanium Desktop) is a remarkable project inherited from Appcelerator. It is now managed as community open source project by group dedicated to the availability of this unique solution. 

The ability to deploy a Webkit-based desktop application across all three major desktop operating systems, with privileged access to native APIs, has empowered web developers to escape the browser and deliver rich, "always on" desktop apps. 

Users create applications using familiar HTML5, JavaScript and CSS technologies. Beyond this, the unique support for Python, PHP and Ruby extend the capabilities of TideSDK beyond the realm of any competitive framework. Further, our plans include the expansion and extension TideSDK's API's for even better, more complex, and reliable user experiences on the desktop as we move forward.
